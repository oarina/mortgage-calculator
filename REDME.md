# Mortgage Calculator for first time home buyers in Ireland.

[Site to go here] This calculator intended to be an estimate of a repayment taking into account the borrowing rate.

***

Morgage estimators online are provided mostly by the lending institutions themselves.

It's hard to know what mortgage rates would be like after the fixed rate term is over or unknow if ECB will hike rates once more or lower them. 

Especially if your mortgage is 30 years it would be good to estimate the the payback rate so that one may be prepared better for more scenarios. 

Back in 1980's in Ireland the interest rates went up to 16% due to inflation (reference https://www.moneyguideireland.com/history-of-mortgage-rates-in-ireland.html). Most likely this will not happen in the next 20 to 30 years, but in the rare chance - why not make a rought estimate?
