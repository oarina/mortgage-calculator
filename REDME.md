# Mortgage Calculator for first time home buyers in Ireland.

[Site to go here] This calculator intended to be an estimate of a repayment taking into account the borrowing rate.

***

Morgage estimators online are provided mostly by the lending institutions themselves.

It's hard to know what mortgage rates would be like after the fixed rate term is over or unknow if ECB will hike rates once more or lower them. 

Especially if your mortgage is 30 years it would be good to estimate the the payback rate so that one may be prepared better for more scenarios. 

Back in 1980's in Ireland the interest rates went up to 16% due to inflation (reference https://www.moneyguideireland.com/history-of-mortgage-rates-in-ireland.html). Most likely this will not happen in the next 20 to 30 years, but in the rare chance - why not make a rought estimate?

* I have kept the form with as little boxes to fill as possible, however, email, name and message boxes are required so you could not send an empty form. 
* This page is also intentionally kept minimalistic and only the form is in the center of a page no matter what device you will have. 
* With nothing but the form the aim is to minimise distractions and help the user fill the form fast easy and then with the header and footer at the users finger tips - the user can get back to what they were previously doing.
